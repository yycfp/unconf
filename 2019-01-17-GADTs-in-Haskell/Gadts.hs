-- |The main point of a Gadt: Constructors can have any signature as
-- long as they return the right type, in this case @Term something@.
-- In particular, a Gadt provides full control over the return type
-- within this constraint.
data Term a where
  Lit :: Int -> Term Int
  IsZero :: Bool -> Term Bool
  TermSum :: Term Int -> Term Int -> Term Int
  TermEq :: Eq a => Term a -> Term a -> Term Bool
  -- |even type variables can be introduced
  TermPair :: Term b -> Term c -> Term (b,c)
-- | This hugely simplifies pattern matching, as in
--
-- > eval :: Term a -> a
--
-- > eval (Lit i) = i
--
-- > eval (IsZero b) = b
--
-- > eval (TermPair t1 t2) = (eval t1, eval t2)
-- and yes, this compiles (and works, after all, this is Haskell)
-- despite the seemingly different return types. However, the type
-- annotation is necessary. Actually, the type variable would be
-- useful just so we can write the type @Term a -> a@.
eval :: Term a -> a
eval (Lit i) = i
eval (IsZero b) = b
eval (TermSum i1 i2) = eval i1 + eval i2
eval (TermEq i1 i2) = eval i1 == eval i2
eval (TermPair t1 t2) = (eval t1, eval t2)
-- |Compare this to the traditional approach, where the type variable is
-- totally redundant. Note that there would be no way to prevent a
-- TermSumTr of a LitTr and an IsZeroTr because they both construct
-- a TermTr a which can be unified to an Int. This needs logic outside
-- of the constructors to prevent that.
data TermTr a  = LitTr Int
               | IsZeroTr Bool
               | TermSumTr (TermTr Int) (TermTr Int)
               | TermPairTr (TermTr a) (TermTr a)
               deriving Show
-- |Now evaluation like in Term doesn't even compile:
-- evalTr :: TermTr a -> a
-- evalTr (LitTr i)= i
-- evalTr (IsZeroTr b) =  b -- conflict in branch return types: Int vs Bool
-- evalTr (TermPairTr t1 t2) = (evalTr t1, evalTr t2)
-- ^ Last one doesn't compile, even by itself because TermPairTr now has
-- type TermTr a and not type TermTr (b,c) because there is no way to
-- construct a TermTr (b,c) without a Gadt.
-- So the result needs to be packed into a type
data Result  = ResultI Int | ResultB Bool | ResultP (Result , Result )
-- | And can be evaluated like below, without much gain, it ends up as nested
-- tuples of Booleans and integers packed into type Result a.
evalTr (TermPairTr t1 t2) = ResultP ((evalTr t1), (evalTr t2))
evalTr (LitTr i ) = ResultI i
evalTr (IsZeroTr b ) = ResultB b

-- Uses: constructor tracking in union types, phantom type handling,
-- existential datatypes, dictionary passing

-- |Dictionary handling
-- Want to make sure sets can only be constructed from ordered data, like so:
-- data Ord a => Set a = MkSet [a]
-- |Alas, constraint needs to be dragged about even if not needed:
-- tailSet :: Ord a => Set a -> Set a
-- tailSet (MkSet l) = MkSet $ tail l
-- These kind of constraints on a type have become obsolete and now
-- require a compiler extension to compile.
-- Replacement for that is a Gadt:
data Set a where
  MkSet :: Ord a => [a] -> Set a
-- Note:
-- data Set a = Ord a => MkSet [a] works, too, in this case.

-- |But here we could also gain some flexibility with a phantom type
data FSet t a where
  MkFSet :: Eq a => [a] -> FSet Plain a
  MkFSetS :: Ord a => [a] -> FSet Sortable a
  MkFSetO :: Ord a => [a] -> FSet Ordered a -- don't export
mkFSetO :: Ord a => [a] -> FSet Ordered a -- use this to get sorted set
mkFSetO  = MkFSetO . sort
-- Note: this is difficult because f :: a -> b but we need
-- f::[a] -> [b]
-- TODO : think about this:
-- This should really be data FSet t (f a) where f is Foldable or at least
-- a functor, then fmap::(f a) -> (f b) -> FSet t (f a) -> FSet t (f b)
-- maybe there should be a special type class for f because we need membership
-- unions, intersections and empty sets, maybe a Monoid with unions as mappend
-- and membership and intersections in addition, perhaps it should be
-- traversable as well.
-- Let's try this: very flexible set: nothing prevents f to be of type [a] for
-- some a, but how do we express sortability? With a type class
class Sortables f where
  sortA :: f -> f
data VFSet t f where
  MkVFSetP ::  f  -> VFSet Plain  f 
  MkVFSetS ::  Sortables f => f  -> VFSet Sortable f

-- alas, fmap needs a Sortable constraint here for the second branch, without
-- Sortables in the constructor, it works.
instance Functor (VFSet t) where
  fmap fun (MkVFSetP x) = MkVFSetP (fun x)
--fmap fun (MkVFSetS x) = MkVFSetS (fun x)
--instance Functor (FSet t) where
  --fmap f (MkFSet l) = MkFSet (f l)
  --fmap f (MkFSetO l) = MkFSetO (f l)
-- |The point: algorithms like searching, removing duplicates and others
-- are more efficient on ordered data.
-- These are the types for the different FSets.
data Plain
-- |As Vinicius pointed out, the original
-- @MkFSetO@ return type of @FSet Ordered a@ was misleading because a
-- constructor can't be made to do any sorting, it just constructs. Hence the
-- additional @Sortable@ type, which better expresses what the constructor does.
data Sortable
-- |This is for actually ordered sets, which can't be constructed but have to
-- be generated by some @sort::FSet Sortable a -> FSet Ordered a@ function.
data Ordered

-- |Now we can use type-classes to track the type of flexible sets and apply
-- the proper search function
class Searcher s a where
  search :: a -> s a -> Maybe a
instance Searcher (FSet Plain) a where
  search e (MkFSet l) = find ( e == ) l
-- This doesn't work anymore because MkFSetO is now Sortable but not ordered
instance Searcher (FSet Ordered) a where
   search e (MkFSetO l) = binarySearch e l 

binarySearch :: (Ord a) => a -> [a] -> Maybe a
binarySearch e l = find (e == ) l --testing only
-- |And then there is the whole issue of phantom types used to track state.
-- For example input from some external source that needs to be processed
-- in a number of stages, for example e-mail addresses, which need to be parsed
-- and validated. One way to keep track of progress is by using a phantom
-- parameter p in an input data type:
data Input c p where
  Fresh :: String -> Input String Raw
  Correct :: String -> Input String Parsed
  Valid :: String -> Input String Validated

deriving instance Show (Input a b) --so the REPL will print results

data InputTypes = Raw|Parsed|Validated
  deriving Show

class Validator a where
  validate :: a -> Input String Validated

instance Validator (Input String Validated) where
  validate=id

validateParsed :: Input String Parsed -> Input String Validated
validateParsed (Correct s) = Valid $ s ++ " :: Valid"

instance Validator (Input String Parsed) where
  validate = validateParsed


-- |A redefinition of lists as GADT. Compare to the regular definition as

  Con :: content -> List state content -> List Populated content

-- That's where inductive types come in handy
